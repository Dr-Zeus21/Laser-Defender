This project was done as part of a crash course on Unity, and so is not very polished.
It was also built as an IOS game, and so the scaling of everything is off.

I included all the scripts as a separate folder because the code there is mostly sound, and honestly more interesting than the actual game.

To play the game, just run the "Lazer Defender" application.
